    We start off strong with my Scratch game called the Final Crumb.
    <br>
    Here is a link where you can watch the whole thing!

    <p> This was one of the first projects we did in the class! I wanted to make something original and blow everyone out of the park. I made and designed all the characters myself, 
    and drew all the art. I had an amazing time making this and letting my creative juices flow! This first Scratch project was a great introduction into the class, and I really enjoyed it. 
    This project got me excited for what was to come next.</p>

The next big project I did was through Alice. Titled: OH NO A BEAR! This project was also super enjoyable. It was similar to Scratch in the way that you could build your code with blocks, 
and it was really fun to assemble the characters and setting by dragging and dropping items. I also thought I did really well with this, and it was another great introduction to warm up to doing bigger 
things with code.

<p>Weeks 6-8 of the class we started a longer project, which happens to be this webstie you are seeing my portfolio through. I struggled with this one a little bit, I will admit. Trying to incooperate CSS 
and learn how to use HTML was a whole different ball park than Scratch and Alice. I took notes and worked hard, managing to get it in order. You already have the link, so feel free to check out the other
pages to this webstie at the bottom of the page!

The next big project I started was the self portrait using JS. I got the hold of this one a little easier because I was still working within a similar format to HTML. I liked this project becasue it
alowed me to get creative and move shapes around. I liked making myself using code and had a lot of fun learning how to situate objects on an x and y axis. The next week on this project we continued to build
off of what we had originally and made the shapes move. Wow that was crazy! I had a hard time with this becuase my shapes didn't really want to do what I was telling them. This later half of the project
took some serious perserverence.
<p> Here is the link to the project!</p>

For this project I was still using HTML and JS, but things got a lot harder, I had to make a game! This was a fun challenge. I remember being continually fustrated because the code kept getting continually
complicated and I was struggling to understand. I learned so much from this project, even though it was'nt the one I enjoyed the most. I worked on this project until the end of class. Each week I added things
and kept continually making it better and more exciting. I think that this project was a fun way to wrap up the class.

<p>This class was a complete joy and I loved every single project I worked on over the course of the semster, even the ones that made me cry a little. Mr.Cassens, you are amazing. Thank you for all
    your help and being willing to meet with me at the oddest hours just for a few minutes of advice. Even though the class was online it still felt as though I was connected with everyone apart of it.
    I made friends, enjoyed engaging in disscussions, and seeing and supporting my fellow class mates work. Thank you!
