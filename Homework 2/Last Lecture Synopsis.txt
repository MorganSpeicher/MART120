I really enjoyed watching the Last Lecture. There were so many pieces of useful and enlightening information in Randy’s speech that I found so inspiring. One of the first things that struck me was the fact that he was able to accomplish or adapt every single one of his childhood dreams, which I found extremely impressive. Usually a childhood dream is something silly, and unattainable. But Randy managed to accomplish every one, and ones that I thought were impossible, like floating in zero gravity. I think that his determination and perseverance really showed how strong of a character he was, and that if you put your mind to it you really can accomplish anything, even your dreams.
        There were a few messages that I really identified with. The first one was about head fake learnings, and his example with the football team. He revealed the fact that when you go to learn something, like sports, you aren’t really there for the logistics of the sport itself, but the important life lessons and character building concepts that you get from “learning” to play football. I think that that is such a great example that you can get a lot out of an experience if you open your mind up to the possibilities, and that experiences you have can change and build your character in more ways than you would have originally expected. 
        Another good piece of advice was the analogy of the brick wall. It was the thought that you will run into many walls in your life that are designed to stop you from achieving your goals, but what matters is how you approach the problem. If you really desire something enough, that wall will only prove to be a challenge for you, and one that you can overcome.
