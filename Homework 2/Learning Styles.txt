I think that the thought of learning styles is very interesting. Before reading the article and watching the video I didn’t really know what a learning style was, or even if they existed. My learning style results were pretty mixed, and on some of the questions all of the options obtained to me, which made it feel like the scores wouldn’t be as accurate. I do believe that it is true that everyone learns differently, or has preferences. I think that there is a possibility that catering more towards your desired learning style might make learning easier or more comfortable for an individual, even if it wasn’t as effective. After reading the article I was shocked by the results. I found the results to be very interesting, and it was a little hard to believe, it was interesting that even if the students used their desired learning style to study it made no difference.
        I’m having a hard time deciding whether or not I believe that learning styles make a difference when it comes to learning, simply just because I am not as educated on the topic. From what I read in the article I couldn’t say that I would let that sway my opinion 100% either. I think that I would have to do some more research and find credible sources to back up the studies and information that was done. In conclusion, I think that learning styles do not affect the productivity and effectiveness of your learning, however, they might make the process more enjoyable, or easier to understand for the individual.
