The GUI (graphic line interface) is what you see when you use your computer normally. GUI allows people to interact with files on their computer through visual representations and icons. GUI allows for easier use, especially for those who are inexperienced or don’t use code at all. It’s easy to use your mouse (a key feature of GUI) to maneuver through your computer's system, dragging, dropping and selecting options through a visual interface for the organization of your files.
        CLI, or code line interface, is a different way of organizing files on your device. Instead of having a visual representation of your computer and files through icons and the use of your mouse, you use written commands represented through lines of text, which you run through a program on your computer. CLI provides more opportunities and options when it comes to organizing and setting parameters on your computer. CLI also isn’t as resource intensive, and for those who know how to use it well, find it easier to navigate than the GUI.
